# HCCNet: Early Prediction of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Longitudinal MRI

## Abstract

For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, early-stage diagnosis continues to be the most important predictor of survival. However, lesion detection typically only occurs at an advanced stage and is largely affected by radiologists' experience. To facilitate patient survival, this repository implements HCCNet - a spatio-temporal neural network that utilizes a 3D ConvNeXt encoder and a transformer decoder.
