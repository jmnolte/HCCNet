  abstract = {Recent advancements in signal processing (SP) and machine learning, coupled with electronic medical record keeping in hospitals and the availability of extensive sets of medical images through internal/external communication systems, have resulted in a recent surge of interest in radiomics. Radiomics, an emerging and relatively new research field, refers to extracting semiquantitative and/or quantitative features from medical images with the goal of developing predictive and/or prognostic models. In the near future, it is expected to be a critical component for integrating image-derived information used for personalized treatment. The conventional radiomics workflow is typically based on extracting predesigned features (also referred to as handcrafted or engineered features) from a segmented region of interest (ROI). Nevertheless, recent advancements in deep learning have inspired trends toward deep-learning-based radiomics (DLRs) (also referred to as discovery radiomics). In addition to the advantages of these two approaches, there are also hybrid solutions that exploit the potential of multiple data sources. Considering the variety of approaches to radiomics, further improvements require a comprehensive and integrated sketch, which is the goal of this article. This article provides a unique interdisciplinary perspective on radiomics by discussing state-of-the-art SP solutions in the context of radiomics.},

The existing studies have mainly used the two Cascaded CNNs for liver segmentation and evaluation of Region Of Interest (ROI). This study uses ResUNet, an updated version of U-Net and ResNet Models that utilize the service of Residential blocks. We apply over method on the 3D-IRCADb01 dataset that is based on CT slices of liver tumor affected patients.

  abstract = {Radiomics is an emerging area in quantitative image analysis that aims to relate large-scale extracted imaging information to clinical and biological endpoints. The development of quantitative imaging methods along with machine learning has enabled the opportunity to move data science research towards translation for more personalized cancer treatments. Accumulating evidence has indeed demonstrated that noninvasive advanced imaging analytics, that is, radiomics, can reveal key components of tumor phenotype for multiple three-dimensional lesions at multiple time points over and beyond the course of treatment. These developments in the use of CT, PET, US, and MR imaging could augment patient stratification and prognostication buttressing emerging targeted therapeutic approaches. In recent years, deep learning architectures have demonstrated their tremendous potential for image segmentation, reconstruction, recognition, and classification. Many powerful open-source and commercial platforms are currently available to embark in new research areas of radiomics. Quantitative imaging research, however, is complex and key statistical principles should be followed to realize its full potential. The field of radiomics, in particular, requires a renewed focus on optimal study design/reporting practices and standardization of image acquisition, feature calculation, and rigorous statistical analysis for the field to move forward. In this article, the role of machine and deep learning as a major computational vehicle for advanced model building of radiomics-based signatures or classifiers, and diverse clinical applications, working principles, research opportunities, and available computational platforms for radiomics will be reviewed with examples drawn primarily from oncology. We also address issues related to common applications in medical physics, such as standardization, feature extraction, model building, and validation.},

These high throughput features can potentially reflect the histology of biologic tissues at macroscopic and microscopic levels. Several studies have investigated radiomics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before and after treatment. HCC is a heterogeneous disease with diverse phenotypical and genotypical landscape. Due to this inherent heterogeneity, HCC lesions can manifest variable aggressiveness with different response to treatment options, including the newer targeted therapies. Hence, radiomics can be used as a potential tool to enable patient selection for therapies and to predict response to treatments and outcome. Additionally, radiomics may serve as a tool for earlier and more efficient assessment of response to treatment. Radiomics, radiogenomics, and radio-immunoprofiling and their potential roles in management of patients with HCC will be discussed and critically reviewed in this article.},

  abstract = {Background/Aims Semiannual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance is recommended in patients with cirrhosis; however, recent studies have raised questions over its utility. We investigated the impact of surveillance on early detection and survival in a nationally representative database. Methods We included patients with cirrhosis and HCC from the Optum database (2001-2015) with {$>$}6 months of follow-up between cirrhosis and HCC diagnoses. Surveillance adherence was defined as proportion of time covered (PTC), with each 6-month period after abdominal imaging defined as `covered'. To determine the association between surveillance and mortality, we compared PTC between fatal and non-fatal HCC. Results Of 1001 patients with cirrhosis and HCC, 256 died with median follow-up 30 months. Median PTC by any imaging was greater in early-stage vs late-stage HCC (43.6\% vs 37.4\%, P = .003) and non-fatal vs fatal HCC (40.8\% vs 34.3\%, P = .001). In multivariable analyses, each 10\% increase in PTC was associated with increased early HCC detection (OR 1.07, 95\% CI 1.01-1.12) and decreased mortality (HR 0.95; 95\% CI 0.90-1.00). On subgroup analysis, PTC by CT/MRI was associated with early tumour detection and decreased mortality; however, PTC by ultrasound was only associated with early detection but not decreased mortality. These findings were robust across sensitivity analyses. Conclusions In a US cohort of privately insured HCC patients, PTC by any imaging modality was associated with increased early detection and decreased mortality. Continued evaluation of HCC surveillance strategies and effectiveness is warranted.},

Models pre-trained from massive dataset such as ImageNet become a powerful weapon for speeding up training convergence and improving accuracy. Similarly, models based on large dataset are important for the development of deep learning in 3D medical images. However, it is extremely challenging to build a sufficiently large dataset due to difficulty of data acquisition and annotation in 3D medical imaging. We aggregate the dataset from several medical challenges to build 3DSeg-8 dataset with diverse modalities, target organs, and pathologies. To extract general medical three-dimension (3D) features, we design a heterogeneous 3D network called Med3D to co-train multi-domain 3DSeg-8 so as to make a series of pre-trained models. We transfer Med3D pre-trained models to lung segmentation in LIDC dataset, pulmonary nodule classification in LIDC dataset and liver segmentation on LiTS challenge. Experiments show that the Med3D can accelerate the training convergence speed of target 3D medical tasks 2 times compared with model pre-trained on Kinetics dataset, and 10 times compared with training from scratch as well as improve accuracy ranging from 3\% to 20\%. Transferring our Med3D model on state-the-of-art DenseASPP segmentation network, in case of single model, we achieve 94.6\textbackslash\% Dice coefficient which approaches the result of top-ranged algorithms on the LiTS challenge.},

The geographic map of the incidence and mortality of HCC has changed over time. Regions that traditionally have lower incidence of HCC, such as North America and certain areas of Europe, have seen increased incidence, and regions that are traditionally high risk, such as Japan and China, have shown declining rates. This observation is likely due to changes in exposure to HCC risk factors, including chronic hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus infection, heavy alcohol consumption, diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis is by and large the most significant risk factor and the foundation for most HCC surveillance programs. When looking at the contribution of risk factors on HCC burden, people must consider the population-attributable fraction, a combination measure of the prevalence of a condition and the risk estimate.},

  abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and resulting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are highly prevalent in the United States, where they are a growing cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and increasingly an indicator for liver transplantation. A Markov model was used to forecast NAFLD disease progression. Incidence of NAFLD was based on historical and projected changes in adult prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Assumptions were derived from published literature where available and validated using national surveillance data for incidence of NAFLD-related HCC. Projected changes in NAFLD-related cirrhosis, advanced liver disease, and liver-related mortality were quantified through 2030. Prevalent NAFLD cases are forecasted to increase 21\%, from 83.1 million (2015) to 100.9 million (2030), while prevalent NASH cases will increase 63\% from 16.52 million to 27.00 million cases. Overall NAFLD prevalence among the adult population (aged {$\geq$}15 years) is projected at 33.5\% in 2030, and the median age of the NAFLD population will increase from 50 to 55 years during 2015-2030. In 2015, approximately 20\% of NAFLD cases were classified as NASH, increasing to 27\% by 2030, a reflection of both disease progression and an aging population. Incidence of decompensated cirrhosis will increase 168\% to 105,430 cases by 2030, while incidence of HCC will increase by 137\% to 12,240 cases. Liver deaths will increase 178\% to an estimated 78,300 deaths in 2030. During 2015-2030, there are projected to be nearly 800,000 excess liver deaths. Conclusion: With continued high rates of adult obesity and DM along with an aging population, NAFLD-related liver disease and mortality will increase in the United States. Strategies to slow the growth of NAFLD cases and therapeutic options are necessary to mitigate disease burden. (Hepatology 2018;67:123-133).},

MRI is accurate for the detection of HCC, but a complete MRI is not feasible as a screening tool. Abbreviated MRI (AMRI) is an acceptable alternative. The diagnostic performance of different AMRI protocols is not known. We performed a systematic review to determine the diagnostic accuracy of AMRI for HCC screening. Methods We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of AMRI for HCC screening. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of different AMRI protocols were calculated based on a random intercept logistic regression model. The diagnostic performance of AMRI was compared with ultrasound. Study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Results Of the 11,327 studies screened by titles, 15 studies (3 prospective and 12 retrospective: 2,807 patients, 917 with HCC) were included in the final analysis. The pooled per-patient sensitivity and specificity were 86\% (95\% CI 84\textendash 88\%, I2 0\%) and 94\% (95\% CI 91\textendash 96\%, I2 83\%), respectively. Pooled per-lesion sensitivity was 77\% (95\% CI 74\textendash 81\%, I2 8\%). There was no influence of study type, screening setting, reference standard, and presence and etiology of cirrhosis on the performance of AMRI. The sensitivity of AMRI for detection of HCC {$<$}2~cm was lower than that for HCC {$\geq$}2~cm (69\% vs. 86\%). The sensitivity and specificity of non-contrast AMRI were comparable to contrast-enhanced AMRI (86\% and 94\% vs. 87\% and 94\%, respectively). The diagnostic performance of different non-contrast AMRI and contrast-enhanced AMRI protocols was comparable. The sensitivity of ultrasound was lower than AMRI (53\% vs. 82\%). Conclusions AMRI has high sensitivity and specificity for HCC screening. Different AMRI protocols have comparable diagnostic performance. Lay summary Abbreviated MRI (AMRI) has been suggested as an alternative to ultrasound and complete MRI for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening. Our study results showed that AMRI has a high per-patient and per-lesion sensitivity for HCC. Although the sensitivity of AMRI for detection of HCC {$<$}2~cm is considerably lower than for HCC {$\geq$}2~cm, it is substantially higher than ultrasound, making it a potential alternative for HCC screening in high-risk populations.},

  abstract = {Background Advances in imaging technology have the potential to transform the early diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through quantitative image analysis. Computational ``radiomic'' techniques extract biomarker information from images which can be used to improve diagnosis and predict tumour biology. Aims To perform a systematic review on radiomic features in HCC diagnosis and prognosis, with a focus on reporting metrics and methodologic standardisation. Methods We performed a systematic review of all full-text articles published from inception through December 1, 2019. Standardised data extraction and quality assessment metrics were applied to all studies. Results A total of 54 studies were included for analysis. Radiomic features demonstrated good discriminatory performance to differentiate HCC from other solid lesions (c-statistics 0.66-0.95), and to predict microvascular invasion (c-statistic 0.76-0.92), early recurrence after hepatectomy (c-statistics 0.71-0.86), and prognosis after locoregional or systemic therapies (c-statistics 0.74-0.81). Common stratifying features for diagnostic and prognostic radiomic tools included analyses of imaging skewness, analysis of the peritumoural region, and feature extraction from the arterial imaging phase. The overall quality of the included studies was low, with common deficiencies in both internal and external validation, standardised imaging segmentation, and lack of comparison to a gold standard. Conclusions Quantitative image analysis demonstrates promise as a non-invasive biomarker to improve HCC diagnosis and management. However, standardisation of protocols and outcome measurement, sharing of algorithms and analytic methods, and external validation are necessary prior to widespread application of radiomics to HCC diagnosis and prognosis in clinical practice.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) is broadly a set of advanced computational algorithms that basically learn the patterns in the data provided to make predictions on unseen data sets. Radiomics can be coupled with AI because of its better capability of handling a massive amount of data compared with the traditional statistical methods. Together, the primary purpose of these fields is to extract and analyze as much and meaningful hidden quantitative data as possible to be used in decision support. Nowadays, both radiomics and AI have been getting attention for their remarkable success in various radiological tasks, which has been met with anxiety by most of the radiologists due to the fear of replacement by intelligent machines. Considering ever-developing advances in computational power and availability of large data sets, the marriage of humans and machines in future clinical practice seems inevitable. Therefore, regardless of their feelings, the radiologists should be familiar with these concepts. Our goal in this paper was three-fold: first, to familiarize radiologists with the radiomics and AI; second, to encourage the radiologists to get involved in these ever-developing fields; and, third, to provide a set of recommendations for good practice in design and assessment of future works.},

However, from a public health perspective, active hepatitis C and B continue to drive most of the global burden of HCC. In United States, the age-adjusted incidence rates of HCC in Hispanics have surpassed those of HCC in Asians. Prognosis in HCC is complex because of the competing risk imposed by underlying cirrhosis and presence of malignancy. In addition to tumor burden, liver function and performance status; additional parameters including tumor biopsy, serum markers, and subclassification of current staging systems; and taking into account patterns of tumor progression may improve patient selection for therapy. Advancements in the treatment of HCC have included identification of patients who are most likely to derive a clinically significant benefit from the available therapeutic options.

Radiomics is an emerging method for quantification of tumor heterogeneity by mathematically analyzing the spatial distribution and relationships of gray levels in medical images. The published studies on radiomics analysis of HCC provide encouraging data demonstrating potential utility for prediction of tumor biology, molecular profiles, post-therapy response, and outcome. The combination of radiomics data and clinical/laboratory information provides added value in many studies. Radiomics is a multi-step process that requires optimization and standardization, the development of semi-automated or automated segmentation methods, robust data quality control, and refinement of algorithms and modeling approaches for high-throughput data analysis. While radiomics remains largely in the research setting, the strong associations of predictive models and nomograms with certain pathologic, molecular, and immune markers with tumor aggressiveness and patient outcomes, provide great potential for clinical applications to inform optimized treatment strategies and patient prognosis.},

This concept was first described as radiomics in 2012. Since then, computer scientists, radiologists, and oncologists have gravitated towards this new tool and exploited advanced methodologies to mine the information behind medical images. On the basis of a great quantity of radiographic images and novel computational technologies, researchers developed and validated radiomic models that may improve the accuracy of diagnoses and therapy response assessments. Here, we review the recent methodological developments in radiomics, including data acquisition, tumor segmentation, feature extraction, and modelling, as well as the rapidly developing deep learning technology. Moreover, we outline the main applications of radiomics in diagnosis, treatment planning and evaluations in the field of oncology with the aim of developing quantitative and personalized medicine.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA)\textendash enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) was performed in diagnosing small HCCs measuring up to 2 cm ({$\leq$}2 cm). Two investigators searched multiple databases for studies in which the performances of either Gd-EOB-DTPA\textendash enhanced MRI or MDCT were reported with sufficient data to construct 2 \texttimes{} 2 contingency tables for diagnosing HCCs up to 2 cm on a per-lesion or per-patient level. Diagnostic performances were quantitatively pooled by a bivariate random-effect model with further meta-regression and subgroup analyses. A total of 27 studies (14 on Gd-EOB-DTPA\textendash enhanced MRI, 9 on MDCT, and 4 on both) were included, enrolling a total of 1735 patients on Gd-EOB-DTPA\textendash enhanced MRI and 1781 patients on MDCT. Gd-EOB-DTPA\textendash enhanced MRI demonstrated significantly higher overall sensitivity than did MDCT (0.96 versus 0.65; P {$<$} 0.01), without substantial loss of specificity (0.94 versus 0.98; P {$>$} 0.05). Area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.97 with Gd-EOB-DTPA\textendash enhanced MRI and 0.85 with MDCT. Regarding Gd-EOB-DTPA\textendash enhanced MRI, sensitivity was significantly higher for studies from non-Asian countries than Asian countries (0.96 versus 0.93; P {$<$} 0.01), for retrospective studies than prospective studies (0.95 versus 0.91; P {$<$} 0.01), and for those with Gd-EOB-DTPA injection rate {$\geq$} 1.5 mL/s than that of {$<$}1.5 mL/s (0.97 versus 0.90; P {$<$} 0.01). In conclusion, Gd-EOB-DTPA\textendash enhanced MRI demonstrated higher sensitivity and overall diagnostic accuracy than MDCT, and thus should be the preferred imaging modality for diagnosing small HCCs measuring up to 2 cm.

  abstract = {Radiomics is a new field in medical imaging with the potential of changing medical practice. Radiomics is characterized by the extraction of several quantitative imaging features which are not visible to the naked eye from conventional imaging modalities, and its correlation with specific relevant clinical endpoints, such as pathology, therapeutic response, and survival. Several studies have evaluated the use of radiomics in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with encouraging results, particularly in the pretreatment prediction of tumor biological characteristics, risk of recurrence, and survival. In spite of this, there are limitations and challenges to be overcome before the implementation of radiomics into clinical routine. In this article, we will review the concepts of radiomics and their current potential applications in patients with HCC. It is important that the multidisciplinary team involved in the treatment of patients with HCC be aware of the basic principles, benefits, and limitations of radiomics in order to achieve a balanced interpretation of the results toward a personalized medicine.},

Modern radiation oncology is based on the exploitation of advanced computational methods aiming to personalization and high diagnostic and therapeutic precision. The quantity of the available imaging data and the increased developments of Machine Learning (ML), particularly Deep Learning (DL), triggered the research on uncovering ``hidden'' biomarkers and quantitative features from anatomical and functional medical images. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved outstanding performance and broad implementation in image processing tasks. Lately, DNNs have been considered for radiomics and their potentials for explainable AI (XAI) may help classification and prediction in clinical practice. However, most of them are using limited datasets and lack generalized applicability. In this study we review the basics of radiomics feature extraction, DNNs in image analysis, and major interpretability methods that help enable explainable AI. Furthermore, we discuss the crucial requirement of multicenter recruitment of large datasets, increasing the biomarkers variability, so as to establish the potential clinical value of radiomics and the development of robust explainable AI models.},

However, there are fundamental differences in data sizes, features and task specifications between natural image classification and the target medical tasks, and there is little understanding of the effects of transfer. In this paper, we explore properties of transfer learning for medical imaging. A performance evaluation on two large scale medical imaging tasks shows that surprisingly, transfer offers little benefit to performance, and simple, lightweight models can perform comparably to ImageNet architectures. Investigating the learned representations and features, we find that some of the differences from transfer learning are due to the over-parametrization of standard models rather than sophisticated feature reuse. We isolate where useful feature reuse occurs, and outline the implications for more efficient model exploration. We also explore feature independent benefits of transfer arising from weight scalings.},

The radiomic process can be divided into distinct steps with definable inputs and outputs, such as image acquisition and reconstruction, image segmentation, features extraction and qualification, analysis, and model building. Each step needs careful evaluation for the construction of robust and reliable models to be transferred into clinical practice for the purposes of prognosis, non-invasive disease tracking, and evaluation of disease response to treatment. After the definition of texture parameters (shape features; first-, second-, and higher-order features), we briefly discuss the origin of the term radiomics and the methods for selecting the parameters useful for a radiomic approach, including cluster analysis, principal component analysis, random forest, neural network, linear/logistic regression, and other. Reproducibility and clinical value of parameters should be firstly tested with internal cross-validation and then validated on independent external cohorts. This article summarises the major issues regarding this multi-step process, focussing in particular on challenges of the extraction of radiomic features from data sets provided by computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.},

To determine if there is a relative diagnostic benefit of one over the other, we synthesized evidence regarding the relative performance of CT, extracellular contrast\textendash enhanced MRI, and gadoxetate-enhanced MRI for diagnosis of HCC in patients with cirrhosis. We also assessed whether liver biopsy versus follow-up with the same versus alternative imaging is best for CT-indeterminate or MRI-indeterminate liver nodules in patients with cirrhosis. We searched multiple databases from inception to April 27, 2016, for studies comparing CT with extracellular contrast\textendash enhanced MRI or gadoxetate-enhanced MRI in adults with cirrhosis and suspected HCC. Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data. Of 33 included studies, 19 were comprehensive, while 14 reported sensitivity only. For all tumor sizes, the 19 comprehensive comparisons showed significantly higher sensitivity (0.82 versus 0.66) and lower negative likelihood ratio (0.20 versus 0.37) for MRI over CT. The specificities of MRI versus CT (0.91 versus 0.92) and the positive likelihood ratios (8.8 versus 8.1) were not different. All three modalities performed better for HCCs {$\geq$}2 cm. Performance was poor for HCCs {$<$}1 cm. No studies examined whether adults with cirrhosis and an indeterminate nodule are best evaluated using biopsy, repeated imaging, or alternative imaging. Concerns about publication bias, inconsistent study results, increased risk of bias, and clinical factors precluded support for exclusive use of either gadoxetate-enhanced or extracellular contrast\textendash enhanced MRI over CT. Conclusion: CT, extracellular contrast\textendash enhanced MRI, or gadoxetate-enhanced MRI could not be definitively preferred for HCC diagnosis in patients with cirrhosis; in patients with cirrhosis and an indeterminate mass, there were insufficient data comparing biopsy to repeat cross-sectional imaging or alternative imaging.

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

  abstract = {Radiomics refers to the extraction of mineable data from medical imaging and has been applied within oncology to improve diagnosis, prognostication, and clinical decision support, with the goal of delivering precision medicine. The authors provide a practical approach for successfully implementing a radiomic workflow from planning and conceptualization through manuscript writing. Applications in oncology typically are either classification tasks that involve computing the probability of a sample belonging to a category, such as benign versus malignant, or prediction of clinical events with a time-to-event analysis, such as overall survival. The radiomic workflow is multidisciplinary, involving radiologists and data and imaging scientists, and follows a stepwise process involving tumor segmentation, image preprocessing, feature extraction, model development, and validation. Images are curated and processed before segmentation, which can be performed on tumors, tumor subregions, or peritumoral zones. Extracted features typically describe the distribution of signal intensities and spatial relationship of pixels within a region of interest. To improve model performance and reduce overfitting, redundant and nonreproducible features are removed. Validation is essential to estimate model performance in new data and can be performed iteratively on samples of the dataset (cross-validation) or on a separate hold-out dataset by using internal or external data. A variety of noncommercial and commercial radiomic software applications can be used. Guidelines and artificial intelligence checklists are useful when planning and writing up radiomic studies. Although interest in the field continues to grow, radiologists should be familiar with potential pitfalls to ensure that meaningful conclusions can be drawn.

We assessed its effects on quality of life and work productivity, as well as its economic burden in the United States. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study of data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS; 2004\textendash 2013). We extracted participants' sociodemographic parameters and medical histories. Subjects with CLD were identified based on Clinical Classification Software codes.~MEPS participants were compared between those with and without CLD, and then between employed and unemployed patients with CLD. Outcomes were quality-of-life scores, employment, and health care use. Results We collected data from 230,406 adult participants (age, {$\geq$}18 y) in the MEPS; 1846 had current CLD (36.7\% with viral hepatitis and 5.3\% with liver cancer). Individuals with CLD were less likely to be employed (44.7\% vs 69.6\% patients without CLD), were not working owing to illness/disability (30.5\% vs 6.6\% without CLD), lost more work because of disability (10.2 vs 3.4 d without CLD), and had more health care use, producing greater health care expenses (\$19,390 vs \$5567/y without CLD) (all P {$<$} .0001). Patients with CLD also had more comorbidities and worse self-reported general and mental health status, and reported more health-related limitations in their daily activities than individuals without CLD (all P {$<$} .0001). They also indicated more psychologic distress and depressive symptoms and had a lower quality of~life and health utility scores (P {$<$} .0001). In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities, the presence of CLD was an important predictor of unemployment (odds ratio, 0.60; 95\% confidence interval, 0.50\textendash 0.70), annual health care expenditure ({$\beta$} = \$9503 {$\pm$} \$2028), and impairment in all aspects of health-related quality of life (all P {$<$} .0001). In patients with CLD, the presence of liver cancer had the most profound impact on health care expenditures ({$\beta~$}= \$17,278 {$\pm$} \$5726/y) and physical health ({$\beta~$}= -7.2 {$\pm$} 1.7 for SF-12 physical component) (all P {$<$} .005). Conclusions In a cross-sectional analysis of MEPS participants, we associated CLD with large economic and quality-of-life burdens.},

  abstract = {Radiomics is an emerging field which extracts quantitative radiology data from medical images and explores their correlation with clinical outcomes in a non-invasive manner. This review aims to assess whether radiomics is a useful and reproducible method for clinical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of current radiomics literature pertaining specifically to HCC. From an initial set of 48 articles recovered through database searches, 23 articles were retained to be included in this review after full screening. Among these 23 studies, 7 used a radiomics approach in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Only two studies applied radiomics to positron emission tomography\textendash computed tomography (PET\textendash CT). In the remaining 14 articles, a radiomics analysis was performed on computed tomography (CT). Eight studies dealt with the relationship between biological signatures and imaging findings, and can be classified as radiogenomic studies. For each study included in our review, we computed a Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) as proposed by Lambin et al. We found that the RQS (mean~{$\pm~$}standard deviation) was 8.35 {$\pm$} 5.38 (out of a possible maximum value of 36). Although these scores are fairly low, and radiomics has not yet reached clinical utility in HCC, it is important to underscore the fact that these early studies pave the way for the radiomics field with a focus on HCC. Radiomics is still a very young field, and is far from being mature, but it remains a very promising technology for the future for developing adequate personalized treatment as a non-invasive approach, for complementing or replacing tumor biopsies, as well as for developing novel prognostic biomarkers in HCC patients.},

  abstract = {Liver diseases, a wide spectrum of pathologies from inflammation to neoplasm, have become an increasingly significant health problem worldwide. Noninvasive imaging plays a critical role in the clinical workflow of liver diseases, but conventional imaging assessment may provide limited information. Accurate detection, characterization and monitoring remain challenging. With progress in quantitative imaging analysis techniques, radiomics emerged as an efficient tool that shows promise to aid in personalized diagnosis and treatment decision-making. Radiomics could reflect the heterogeneity of liver lesions via extracting high-throughput and high-dimensional features from multi-modality imaging. Machine learning algorithms are then used to construct clinical target-oriented imaging biomarkers to assist disease management. Here, we review the methodological process in liver disease radiomics studies in a stepwise fashion from data acquisition and curation, region of interest segmentation, liver-specific feature extraction, to task-oriented modelling. Furthermore, the applications of radiomics in liver diseases are outlined in aspects of diagnosis and staging, evaluation of liver tumour biological behaviours, and prognosis according to different disease type. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of radiomics in liver disease studies and explore its future opportunities.},

Risk factors for HCC include chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C, alcohol addiction, metabolic liver disease (particularly nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) and exposure to dietary toxins such as aflatoxins and aristolochic acid. All these risk factors are potentially preventable, highlighting the considerable potential of risk prevention for decreasing the global burden of HCC. HCC surveillance and early detection increase the chance of potentially curative treatment; however, HCC surveillance is substantially underutilized, even in countries with sufficient medical resources. Early-stage HCC can be treated curatively by local ablation, surgical resection or liver transplantation. Treatment selection depends on tumour characteristics, the severity of underlying liver dysfunction, age, other medical comorbidities, and available medical resources and local expertise. Catheter-based locoregional treatment is used in patients with intermediate-stage cancer. Kinase and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to be effective treatment options in patients with advanced-stage HCC. Together, rational deployment of prevention, attainment of global goals for viral hepatitis eradication, and improvements in HCC surveillance and therapy hold promise for achieving a substantial reduction in the worldwide HCC burden within the next few decades.},

  abstract = {Background: Early-stage diagnosis and treatment can improve survival rates of liver cancer patients. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI provides the most comprehensive information for differential diagnosis of liver tumors. However, MRI diagnosis is affected by subjective experience, so deep learning may supply a new diagnostic strategy. We used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop a deep learning system (DLS) to classify liver tumors based on enhanced MR images, unenhanced MR images, and clinical data including text and laboratory test results., Methods: Using data from 1,210 patients with liver tumors (N = 31,608 images), we trained CNNs to get seven-way classifiers, binary classifiers, and three-way malignancy-classifiers (Model A-Model G). Models were validated in an external independent extended cohort of 201 patients (N = 6,816 images). The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were compared across different models. We also compared the sensitivity and specificity of models with the performance of three experienced radiologists., Results: Deep learning achieves a performance on par with three experienced radiologists on classifying liver tumors in seven categories. Using only unenhanced images, CNN performs well in distinguishing malignant from benign liver tumors (AUC, 0.946; 95\% CI 0.914\textendash 0.979 vs. 0.951; 0.919\textendash 0.982, P = 0.664). New CNN combining unenhanced images with clinical data greatly improved the performance of classifying malignancies as hepatocellular carcinoma (AUC, 0.985; 95\% CI 0.960\textendash 1.000), metastatic tumors (0.998; 0.989\textendash 1.000), and other primary malignancies (0.963; 0.896\textendash 1.000), and the agreement with pathology was 91.9\%.These models mined diagnostic information in unenhanced images and clinical data by deep-neural-network, which were different to previous methods that utilized enhanced images. The sensitivity and specificity of almost every category in these models reached the same high level compared to three experienced radiologists., Conclusion: Trained with data in various acquisition conditions, DLS that integrated these models could be used as an accurate and time-saving assisted-diagnostic strategy for liver tumors in clinical settings, even in the absence of contrast agents. DLS therefore has the potential to avoid contrast-related side effects and reduce economic costs associated with current standard MRI inspection practices for liver tumor patients.},

  abstract = {Background Radiomic features may quantify characteristics present in medical imaging. However, the lack of standardized definitions and validated reference values have hampered clinical use. Purpose To standardize a set of 174 radiomic features. Materials and Methods Radiomic features were assessed in three phases. In phase I, 487 features were derived from the basic set of 174 features. Twenty-five research teams with unique radiomics software implementations computed feature values directly from a digital phantom, without any additional image processing. In phase II, 15 teams computed values for 1347 derived features using a CT image of a patient with lung cancer and predefined image processing configurations. In both phases, consensus among the teams on the validity of tentative reference values was measured through the frequency of the modal value and classified as follows: less than three matches, weak; three to five matches, moderate; six to nine matches, strong; 10 or more matches, very strong. In the final phase (phase III), a public data set of multimodality images (CT, fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and T1-weighted MRI) from 51 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma was used to prospectively assess reproducibility of standardized features. Results Consensus on reference values was initially weak for 232 of 302 features (76.8\%) at phase I and 703 of 1075 features (65.4\%) at phase II. At the final iteration, weak consensus remained for only two of 487 features (0.4\%) at phase I and 19 of 1347 features (1.4\%) at phase II. Strong or better consensus was achieved for 463 of 487 features (95.1\%) at phase I and 1220 of 1347 features (90.6\%) at phase II. Overall, 169 of 174 features were standardized in the first two phases. In the final validation phase (phase III), most of the 169 standardized features could be excellently reproduced (166 with CT; 164 with PET; and 164 with MRI). Conclusion A set of 169 radiomics features was standardized, which enabled verification and calibration of different radiomics software. \textcopyright{} RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
